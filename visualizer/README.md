# AoC Visualizer

*Requires Node.js.*

This tool generates a standalone (expect for the font) html-file visualizing the timestamps for correct submission of each day.

Download the json-file from your private leaderboard and place it in the same folder as `visualizer.js` and name in leaderboard.json.

Run `node visualizer.js`, open the generated `index.html` file in any web browser.
